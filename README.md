# QA Factory

A QA agent pipeline with end-to-end tracing and rule-based failure attribution, evaluated against a small app with seeded bugs. Spec: [docs/spec-v2.md](docs/spec-v2.md).

## Current status: Phase 0 (SUT and benchmark)

- **SUT**: `sut/` is a TaskBoard app (FastAPI + in-memory SQLite + one HTML page) with users, projects, members and tasks that move through a status state machine.
- **Seeded bugs**: 10 bugs in 8 categories, listed in [benchmark/bugs.yaml](benchmark/bugs.yaml). They are switched on with `SUT_BUGS`, and every injection point is an `is_enabled("Bxx")` call in `sut/app.py`.
- **Requirements**: [benchmark/requirements/](benchmark/requirements/) has REQ-001 to REQ-009.
- **Reference tests**: [benchmark/reference_tests/](benchmark/reference_tests/) has one hand-written, black-box test per bug. API bugs are tested with httpx and UI bugs with Playwright.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"            # plus `playwright install chromium` if no browser is present
SUT_BUGS=B01,B04 uvicorn sut.app:app
python -m benchmark.matrix         # acceptance matrix -> benchmark/results/phase0_matrix.md
pytest tests                       # flag mechanism + manifest consistency
```

## Known limitations

- **UI bugs are visible in the page source.** B05 and B10 are injected server-side by swapping JS snippets. The served page looks like naturally buggy code with no flag names, but a reader can still spot the bug by reading it.
- **Weak identity.** Users are identified only by the `X-User` header. There is no real authentication.
- **B01 needs multiple pages.** It only triggers when pagination has moved past the first page (`offset > 0`), so the single-page UI list is unaffected.
- **No isolation between agents and the SUT yet.** Permission isolation is at level L0 (nothing enforced yet; see spec §7.2).
